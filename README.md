STOP! Go no further...



Adhering to this Covie-19 protocol is beginning to take a tool on me. Every week an adjustment has to be made at Church. Seating patterns have to be adjusted. Social distancing need to be observed not to mention mask wearing on Church property & the forbiddance of congregating before & after Church.



Church life for me in a wheelchair is far from as glamorous as it use to be. The re-emphasis has again shifted from Heavenly Father and His Son. 



CORRECTION; We are all Brothers and Sisters of Heavenly Father. That make Jesus Christ our big brother.



Remember the slaying of Abel by Cain in Genesis ( in the Bible ) ? Heavenly Father enquired of Cain the whereabouts of Abel ( Heavenly Father already knew that Cain had already slain Abel and had probably buried or discarded of  the body ).



Cain casually replied ' I KNOW NOT. AM I MY BROTHER'S KEEPER? '



What an answer to give. Of course you are your brother's keeper.



This reminds me of a Sister I knew ( notice I said knew rather than know ) at Church. She makes the most awesome pastries. ( my mouth is watering as I type with just the thought of them, And YES, they were that good. )



One day I put my pride aside and followed my tummy! You would never guess what Karen replied to me saying?



NO! Absolute NO.



That is my grandmother's secret recipe and just like her, I'm taking it to the grave with me. Well you can imagine how the story ended? For me it was CASE CLOSED!



That would be a while before I salivate over food. 



I believe that when you've found or created something awesome, it's your duty to share it with others. If you knew somewhere where the was a Never ending source of exposure if you were an Affiliate Marketer like me? Won't you share it?



Well such a place do exist and a link to it can be found in HERE. This is from me to you. They say that knowledge is power. Please enjoy the transferal of power.



Now you may be a bit curious as to where I'm sending you. I quite understand. We are surrounded by an environment that is full of deception. Hacking has become the norm but as in all things, proceed in faith.



Back to the contents of this Website. Brought to you by Worldprofit who happens to be among the leaders in internet security.



Expect to find: 



1) Several Free offers of credits 



2) Several inexpensive ways to pay for annual traffic ( human ) with the ability to change the link or word attraction as many time as you like.



3) As you can read, proper writing skills are most important. We have that too.



4) Building an effective splash page, opt in, capture page is a must. We have access to some of the best



5) An SEO service is greatly underestimated when it comes to affiliate marketing. Getting rated among the top of worldwide search engines like Google, Bing, Yahoo etc & using Chrome, Safari and Explorer can generate tons of organic traffic on autopilot. Backlinks, keywords and such can be useful. All the programs are made available by several different vendors at the site.



6) Several traffic programs are listed however none are recommended as this may show bias. They all have their benefits and downfalls.



My suggestion is to try several. This guarantees you getting traffic from a number of places.



A word of caution. Avoid traffic sources that advertise the use of Bots. Bots cannot make purchases.



The site would not be a site unless it was filled with it's  fair share of ' get rich quick schemes '.



With all the new traffic programs, now we need products to promote. We offer both digital & non-digital ( traditional ). Find them!



Now comes the health portion. The increase in wealth that you will have makes it possible to invest in wholesome, good food.



I have included Ketogenic & a Paleo cookbook along with a program to help you stop smoking.



We considered everything and is designed with you in mind taking into consideration existing Covid-19 protocols.



I hope you enjoy my assembly of Affiliate marketing paraphernalia as much as I did bringing it to you.
